The current ASP.NET 3.5 synchronous pipeline events are listed in the order that they occur as follows: 
1. BeginRequest 
2. AuthenticateRequest 
3. PostAuthenticateRequest 
4. AuthorizeRequest 
5. PostAuthorizeRequest 
6. ResolveRequestCache 
7. PostResolveRequestCache 
8. MapRequestHandler 
9. PostMapRequestHandler 
10. AcquireRequestState 
11. PostAcquireRequestState 
12. PreRequestHandlerExecute 
At this stage, the selected handler executes the current request. The most familiar handler is the 
Page handler. 
13. PostRequestHandlerExecute 
14. ReleaseRequestState 
15. PostReleaseRequestState 
16. UpdateRequestCache 
17. PostUpdateRequestCache 
18. LogRequest 
19. PostLogRequest 
20. EndRequest 
ASP.NET 3.5 adds three new stages to the unified integrated request-processing pipeline. These events are only used when the integrated mode is configured: 
1. MapRequestHandler : At this stage a handler is selected based on the content file type extension that is requested. Either a native module such as the StaticFileModule handler or a managed module such as PageHandlerFactory can be selected 
2. LogRequest: Fires just after the PostUpdateRequestCache event. Even if an error occurs in the request processing, this even still fires. Both native and managed modules can subscribe to this event. 
3. PostLogRequest: This event fires just after LogRequest event fires.
